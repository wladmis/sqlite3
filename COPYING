http://www.sqlite.org/different.html:

  The source code for SQLite is in the public domain. No claim of copyright is
  made on any part of the core source code. (The documentation and test code is
  a different matter - some sections of documentation and test logic are
  governed by open-sources licenses.) All contributors to the SQLite core
  software have signed affidavits specifically disavowing any copyright
  interest in the code. This means that anybody is able to legally do anything
  they want with the SQLite source code.

The SQLite executable (command line interface) of this build uses the GNU
readline library, which is subject to the GNU General Public License.  However,
the SQLite library itself does not link with readline and thus is not tainted
by the GPL.

The lemon parser generator is now maintained as part of the SQLite project.
Both the source code to lemon itself and the code that lemon generates are in
the public domain. (http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/)
