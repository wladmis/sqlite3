#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This test tries to exercise a race-condition that existed in shared-cache
# mode at one point. The test uses two threads; each has a database connection
# open on the same shared cache. The schema of the database is:
#
#    CREATE TABLE t1(a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, b UNIQUE);
#
# One thread is a reader and the other thread a reader and a writer. The 
# writer thread repeats the following transaction as fast as possible:
# 
#      BEGIN;
#        DELETE FROM t1 WHERE a = (SELECT max(a) FROM t1);
#        INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(NULL, NULL);
#        UPDATE t1 SET b = a WHERE a = (SELECT max(a) FROM t1);
#        SELECT count(*) FROM t1 WHERE b IS NULL;
#      COMMIT;
#
# The reader thread does the following over and over as fast as possible:
#
#      BEGIN;
#        SELECT count(*) FROM t1 WHERE b IS NULL;
#      COMMIT;
#
# The test runs for 20 seconds or until one of the "SELECT count(*)" 
# statements returns a non-zero value. If an SQLITE_LOCKED error occurs,
# the connection issues a ROLLBACK immediately to abandon the current
# transaction.
#
# If everything is working correctly, the "SELECT count(*)" statements 
# should never return a value other than 0. The "INSERT" statement 
# executed by the writer adds a row with "b IS NULL" to the table, but
# the subsequent UPDATE statement sets its "b" value to an integer
# immediately afterwards.
#
# However, before the race-condition was fixed, if the reader's SELECT
# statement hit an error (say an SQLITE_LOCKED) at the same time as the
# writer was executing the UPDATE statement, then it could incorrectly
# rollback the statement-transaction belonging to the UPDATE statement.
# The UPDATE statement would still be reported as successful to the user,
# but it would have no effect on the database contents.
# 
# Note that it has so far only proved possible to hit this race-condition
# when using an ATTACHed database. There doesn't seem to be any reason
# for this, other than that operating on an ATTACHed database means there
# are a few more mutex grabs and releases during the window of time open
# for the race-condition. Maybe this encourages the scheduler to context
# switch or something...
#

# Use shared-cache mode for this test.
