# Test organization:
#
# shared-1.*: Simple test to verify basic sanity of table level locking when
#             two connections share a pager cache.
# shared-2.*: Test that a read transaction can co-exist with a 
#             write-transaction, including a simple test to ensure the 
#             external locking protocol is still working.
# shared-3.*: Simple test of read-uncommitted mode.
#
# shared-4.*: Check that the schema is locked and unlocked correctly.

# Tests shared-4.* test that the schema locking rules are applied 
# correctly. i.e.:
#
# 1. All transactions require a read-lock on the schemas of databases they
#    access.
# 2. Transactions that modify a database schema require a write-lock on that
#    schema.
# 3. It is not possible to compile a statement while another handle has a 
#    write-lock on the schema.
#

# Open two database handles db and db2. Each has a single attach database
