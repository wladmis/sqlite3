# Test cases autovacuum-1.* work as follows:
#
# 1. A table with a single indexed field is created.
# 2. Approximately 20 rows are inserted into the table. Each row is long 
#    enough such that it uses at least 2 overflow pages for both the table 
#    and index entry.
# 3. The rows are deleted in a psuedo-random order. Sometimes only one row
#    is deleted per transaction, sometimes more than one.
# 4. After each transaction the table data is checked to ensure it is correct
#    and a "PRAGMA integrity_check" is executed.
# 5. Once all the rows are deleted the file is checked to make sure it 
#    consists of exactly 4 pages.
#
# Steps 2-5 are repeated for a few different psuedo-random delete patterns 
# (defined by the $delete_orders list).
