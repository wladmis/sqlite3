This directory is intended to hold "experimental" files.

The code in this directory does not necessary work.  It may
or may not be added to future SQLite releases.  We just need
a place to put ideas and works-in-progress and so this 
directory was created.

If you are interested in the production versions of SQLite,
you can safely ignore this directory.
