** This file defines the interface to the database backend (Dbbe).

/*
** The database backend supports two opaque structures.  A Dbbe is
** a context for the entire set of tables forming a complete
** database.  A DbbeCursor is a pointer into a single single table.
**
** Note that at this level, the term "table" can mean either an
** SQL table or an SQL index.  In this module, a table stores a
** single arbitrary-length key and corresponding arbitrary-length
** data.  The differences between tables and indices, and the
** segregation of data into various fields or columns is handled
** by software at higher layers.
**
** The DbbeCursor structure holds some state information, such as
** the key and data from the last retrieval.  For this reason, 
** the backend must allow the creation of multiple independent
** DbbeCursor structures for each table in the database.
