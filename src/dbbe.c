** of information to the disk.
**
** This file uses GDBM as the database backend.  It should be
** relatively simple to convert to a different database such
** as NDBM, SDBM, or BerkeleyDB.

** kind of database to open.  If the first characters are "gdbm:",
** then it uses the GDBM driver.  If the first few characters are
** "memory:" then it uses the in-memory driver.  If there is no
** match, the default to the GDBM driver.
**
** If successful, a pointer to the Dbbe structure is returned.
** If there are errors, an appropriate error message is left
** in *pzErrMsg and NULL is returned.
