**
** To avoid deadlocks, multiple Btrees are locked in the same order
** by all database connections.  The p->pNext is a list of other
** Btrees belonging to the same database connection as the p Btree
** which need to be locked after p.  If we cannot get a lock on
** p, then first unlock all of the others on p->pNext, then wait
** for the lock to become available on p, then relock all of the
** subsequent Btrees that desire a lock.
