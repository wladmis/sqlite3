**
** This file contains the implementation of the RowHash data structure.
** A RowHash has the following properties:
**
**   *  A RowHash stores an unordered "bag" of 64-bit integer rowids.
**      There is no other content.
**
**   *  Primative operations are CREATE, INSERT, TEST, and DESTROY.
**      There is no way to remove individual elements from the RowHash
**      once they are inserted.
**
**   *  INSERT operations are batched.  TEST operation will ignore
**      elements in the current INSERT batch.  Only elements inserted
**      in prior batches will be seen by a TEST.
**
** The insert batch number is a parameter to the TEST primitive.  The
** hash table is rebuilt whenever the batch number increases.  TEST
** operations only look for INSERTs that occurred in prior batches.
**
** The caller is responsible for insuring that there are no duplicate
** INSERTs.
