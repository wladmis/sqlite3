<title>Well-Known Users Of SQLite</title>

<h2>Well-Known Users of SQLite:</h2>

<p>
A few of the better-known users of SQLite are shown below
in alphabetical order.
There is no complete list of projects and companies
that use SQLite.
SQLite is in the 
<a href="copyright.html">public domain</a> and so many people use it
in their projects without ever telling us.

<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> uses SQLite for many functions 
within Mac OS-X, including 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail.html">Apple Mail</a>, 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari.html">Safari</a>, 
and in <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperature/">Aperture</a>.
There are unconfirmed reports on the internet that Apple also uses SQLite in
the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> and in the

The <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Firefox Web Browser</a> from Mozilla 
has been slowly replacing their legacy file format "mork" with SQLite
for about two years.  At this point, SQLite is used to store most
persistent metadata in Firefox.

</td><td>
We believe that <a href="http://www.ge.com/">General Electric</a>
uses SQLite in some product or 
another because they twice wrote the to SQLite developers requesting 
the US Export Control Number for SQLite. So presumably GE is using
SQLite in something that they are exporting. But nobody
(outside of GE) seems to know what that might be.

It is known that
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>
uses SQLite in their 
<a href="http://desktop.gooogle.com/mac/legal.html">Desktop for Mac</a>,
in <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html">Google 
Gears</a>, and in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> cell-phone 
operating system.
People are suspicious that Google uses SQLite for lots of other things
that we do not know about yet.
Engineers at Google have made extensive contributions to the
full-text search subsystem within SQLite.

It can inferred from 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@sqlite.org/msg19226.html">
traffic on the SQLite mailing list</a> that at least
one group within 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>
is using SQLite in the development of a 
game program. No word yet if this game has actually been released or
if they are still using SQLite.

an SQLite database. Each file is a separate BLOB.

It is reported that

use SQLite to store metadata about the music they hold.
Apparently, if you plug a Philips MP3 player into your USB port, you
can see the SQLite database file there in plain sight.

do not know what that something is.
