<h2>SQLite Support Options</h2>

<h3>Professional Support</h3>

<p>
If you would like professional support for SQLite
or if you want custom modifications performed by the
original author or SQLite, these services are available for a modest fee.

<h3>Proprietary SQLite Extensions</h3>

<p>The core SQLite library found on this website is in the
<a href="copyright.html">public domain</a>.  But there also exist
proprietary, licensed extensions to SQLite, written and maintained
by the original developer.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/see.html">SQLite Encryption
Extension (SEE)</a> will read and write database file encrypted using
128-bit or 256-bit AES.</p></li>

<li><p>
The <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/cerod.html">
SQLite Compressed and Encrypted Read-Only Database (CEROD)</a>
Extension will read a database file that is both compressed
and encrypted.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>Three separate mailing lists have been established to help support
SQLite:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sqlite.org:8080/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-announce">
sqlite-announce</a> - announcements of new
releases or significant developments.</li>
<li><a href="http://sqlite.org:8080/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-users">
sqlite-users</a> - general user discussion; most postings belong here.</li>
<li><a href="http://sqlite.org:8080/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-dev">
sqlite-dev</a> - developer conversations; for people who have or aspire to
have write permission on the SQLite CVS repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most users of SQLite will want to join the
<a href="http://sqlite.org:8080/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-announce">
sqlite-announce</a> list and many will want to join the
<a href="http://sqlite.org:8080/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-users">
sqlite-users</a> list.  The
<a href="http://sqlite.org:8080/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-dev">
sqlite-dev</a> list is more specialized and appeals to a narrower audience.
Off-site archives of the
<a href="http://sqlite.org:8080/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-users">
sqlite-users</a> list are available at:

<h3>Direct E-Mail To The Author</h3>

<p>
Use the mailing list.
Please do <b>not</b> send email directly to the author of SQLite
unless:
<ul>
<li>You have or intend to acquire a professional support contract
as described above, or</li>
<li>You are working on an open source project.</li>
</ul>
You are welcomed to use SQLite in closed source, proprietary, and/or
commerical projects and to ask questions about such use on the public
mailing list.  But please do not ask to receive free direct technical
support.  The software is free; direct technical support is not.
</p>
