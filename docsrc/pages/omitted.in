<h2>SQL Features That SQLite Does Not Implement</h2>

<p>
Rather than try to list all the features of SQL92 that SQLite does
support, it is much easier to list those that it does not.
Unsupported features of SQL92 are shown below.</p>

<p>
The order of this list gives some hint as to when a feature might
be added to SQLite.  Those features near the top of the list are
likely to be added in the near future.  There are no immediate
plans to add features near the bottom of the list.

<tcl>
proc feature {name desc} {
  hd_puts "<tr><td valign=\"top\"><b><nobr>$name</nobr></b></td>"
  hd_puts "<td width=\"10\">&nbsp;</th>"
  hd_puts "<td valign=\"top\">$desc</td></tr>"
}

feature {FOREIGN KEY constraints} {
  FOREIGN KEY constraints are parsed but are not enforced.
  However, the equivalent constraint enforcement can be achieved
  using triggers.  The SQLite source tree contains 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/fileview?f=sqlite/tool/genfkey.c">
  source code</a> and 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/fileview?f=sqlite/tool/genfkey.README">
  documentation</a> for a C program that will read an SQLite database,
  analyze the foreign key constraints, and generate appropriate triggers
  automatically.
}

feature {Complete trigger support} {
  There is some support for triggers but it is not complete.  Missing
  subfeatures include FOR EACH STATEMENT triggers (currently all triggers
  must be FOR EACH ROW), INSTEAD OF triggers on tables (currently 
  INSTEAD OF triggers are only allowed on views), and recursive
  triggers - triggers that trigger themselves.
}

feature {Complete ALTER TABLE support} {
  Only the RENAME TABLE and ADD COLUMN variants of the 
  ALTER TABLE command are supported.  Other kinds of ALTER TABLE operations
  such as
  DROP COLUMN, ALTER COLUMN, ADD CONSTRAINT, and so forth are omitted.
}

feature {RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOIN} {
  LEFT OUTER JOIN is implemented, but not RIGHT OUTER JOIN or
  FULL OUTER JOIN.
}

feature {Writing to VIEWs} {
  VIEWs in SQLite are read-only.  You may not execute a DELETE, INSERT, or
  UPDATE statement on a view. But you can create a trigger
  that fires on an attempt to DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE a view and do
  what you need in the body of the trigger.
}

feature {GRANT and REVOKE} {
  Since SQLite reads and writes an ordinary disk file, the
  only access permissions that can be applied are the normal
  file access permissions of the underlying operating system.
  The GRANT and REVOKE commands commonly found on client/server
  RDBMSes are not implemented because they would be meaningless
  for an embedded database engine.
