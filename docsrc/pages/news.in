newsitem {2007-Nov-05} {Version 3.5.2} {
  This is an incremental release that fixes several minor problems,
  adds some obscure features, and provides some performance tweaks.  
  Upgrading is optional.

  The experimental compile-time option
  SQLITE_OMIT_MEMORY_ALLOCATION is no longer supported.  On the other
  hand, it is now possible to compile SQLite so that it uses a static
  array for all its dynamic memory allocation needs and never calls
  malloc.  Expect to see additional radical changes to the memory 
  allocation subsystem in future releases.
}

newsitem {2007-Oct-04} {Version 3.5.1} {
  Fix a long-standing bug that might cause database corruption if a
  disk-full error occurs in the middle of a transaction and that
  transaction is not rolled back.
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2686">Ticket #2686.</a>

  The new VFS layer is stable.  However, we still reserve the right to
  make tweaks to the interface definition of the VFS if necessary.
}

newsitem {2007-Sep-04} {Version 3.5.0 alpha} {
  The OS interface layer and the memory allocation subsystems in
  SQLite have been reimplemented.  The published API is largely unchanged
  but the (unpublished) OS interface has been modified extensively.  
  Applications that implement their own OS interface will require
  modification.  See
  <a href="34to35.html">34to35.html</a> for details.<p>

  This is a large change.  Approximately 10% of the source code was
  modified.  We are calling this first release "alpha" in order to give
  the user community time to test and evaluate the changes before we
  freeze the new design.
