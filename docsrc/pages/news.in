newsitem {2008-Jan-31} {Version 3.5.5} {
  Version 3.5.5 changes over 8% of the core source code of SQLite in order
  to convert the internal virtual machine from a stack-based design into
  a register-based design.  This change will allow future optimizations
  and will avoid an entire class of stack overflow bugs that have caused
  problems in the past.  Even though this change is large, extensive testing
  has found zero errors in the new virtual machine and so we believe this
  to be a very stable release.
}

newsitem {2007-Dec-14} {Version 3.5.4} {
  Version 3.5.4 fixes an long-standing but obscure bug in UPDATE and
  DELETE which might cause database corruption.  (See ticket #2832.)
  Upgrading is recommended for all users.

  This release also brings the processing of ORDER BY statements into
  compliance with standard SQL.  This could, in theory, cause problems
  for existing applications that depend on the older, buggy behavior.
  See ticket #2822 for additional information.

newsitem {2007-Dec-12} {SQLite Consortium Announced} {
  The <a href="consortium.html">SQLite Consortium</a> was launched
  today with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> and
  <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a> as charter members.
  As noted in the <a href="pressrelease-20071212.html">press release</a>,
  the Consortium's goal is to promote the continuing vitality and
  independence of SQLite.  
}
newsitem {2007-Nov-27} {Version 3.5.3} {
  This is an incremental release that fixes several minor problems.
  Upgrading is optional.  If Version 3.5.2 or 3.5.1 is working fine
  for you, then there is no pressing need to change to 3.5.3.

  The prebuilt binaries and the amalgamation found on the 
  <a href="download.html">download</a> page include the FTS3 fulltext
  search extension module.  We are doing this on an experimental
  basis and are not promising to provide prebuilt binaries with
  FTS3 in the future.
