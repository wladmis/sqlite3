doc {Appropriate Uses For SQLite} {whentouse.html} {
  This document describes situations where SQLite is an appropriate
  database engine to use versus situations where a client/server
  database engine might be a better choice.
}

doc {Distinctive Features} {different.html} {
  This document enumerates and describes some of the features of
  SQLite that make it different from other SQL database engines.
}

doc {SQLite In 5 Minutes Or Less} {quickstart.html} {
  A very quick introduction to programming with SQLite.
}

doc {SQL Syntax} {lang.html} {
  This document describes the SQL language that is understood by

}
doc {Frequently Asked Questions} {faq.html} {
  The title of the document says all...
}
doc {Sharing Cache Mode} {sharedcache.html} {
  Version 3.3.0 and later supports the ability for two or more
  database connections to share the same page and schema cache.
  This feature is useful for certain specialized applications.
}
doc {Tcl API} {tclsqlite.html} {
  A description of the TCL interface bindings for SQLite.
}

doc {Temporary Files Used By SQLite} {tempfiles.html} {
  SQLite can potentially use many different temporary files when
  processing certain SQL statements.  This document describes the
  many kinds of temporary files that SQLite uses and offers suggestions
  for avoiding them on systems where creating a temporary file is an
  expensive operation.
}

doc {How SQLite Implements Atomic Commit} {atomiccommit.html} {
  A description of the logic within SQLite that implements
  transactions with atomic commit, even in the face of power
  failures.
}
doc {Moving From SQLite 3.4 to 3.5} {34to35.html} {
  A document describing the differences between SQLite version 3.4.2
  and 3.5.0.
}

  This document describes SQLite performance tuning options and other 
  special purpose database commands.
}
doc {SQLite Version 3} {version3.html} {
  A summary of of the changes between SQLite version 2.8 and SQLite version 3.0.
}
doc {Version 3 C/C++ API} {capi3.html} {
  A description of the C/C++ interface bindings for SQLite version 3.0.0
  and following.
}
doc {Version 3 DataTypes } {datatype3.html} {
  SQLite version 3 introduces the concept of manifest typing, where the
  type of a value is associated with the value itself, not the column that
  it is stored in.
  This page describes data typing for SQLite version 3 in further detail.
}

doc {Locking And Concurrency<br>In SQLite Version 3} {lockingv3.html} {
  A description of how the new locking code in version 3 increases
  concurrency and decreases the problem of writer starvation.

  A quick overview of the various query optimizations that are
  attempted by the SQLite code generator.
}


doc {Null Handling} {nulls.html} {

  SQL standards are ambiguous.  This document describes how SQLite handles
  NULLs in comparison with other SQL database engines.
}

  to hack the code.
}

doc {VDBE Tutorial} {vdbe.html} {
  The VDBE is the subsystem within SQLite that does the actual work of
  executing SQL statements.  This page describes the principles of operation
  for the VDBE in SQLite version 2.7.  This is essential reading for anyone
  who want to modify the SQLite sources.
}

doc {VDBE Opcodes} {opcode.html} {
  This document is an automatically generated description of the various
  opcodes that the VDBE understands.  Programmers can use this document as
  a reference to better understand the output of EXPLAIN listings from
  SQLite.
}

doc {Compilation Options} {compile.html} {
  This document describes the compile time options that may be set to 
  modify the default behavior of the library or omit optional features
  in order to reduce binary size.
}
