<h1>System Requirements For SQLite</h1>

<p>This document outlines the chief goals and objectives of the SQLite
library. All of the features and capabilities of SQLite (that is to say,
the [requirements] of SQLite) can 
ultimately be traced back to one of the broad and general
requirements specified here.</p>

<p>SQLite is not a complete system and so the requirements
provided by this document are not system requirements in the
strict sense.  Perhaps "sub-system requirements" would be a better
term, since SQLite is always a sub-component of a larger system.</p>

<p>This document is targeted primarily at developers who are
working within a waterfall development model that uses detailed
requirements written with the modal auxiliary verb "shall".  
However, this document is also useful as a general-purpose high-level 
description of SQLite for developers who are not working under
different development paradigms.</p>

hd_read_requirement_file $::DOC/req/asysreq.txt SYSREQ
foreach id $SYSREQ(*) {
  hd_fragment $id $id
  hd_puts "<p><b>$id:</b>\n"
  hd_resolve [lindex $SYSREQ($id) 1]\n
  set comment [lindex $SYSREQ($id) 2]
  if {$comment!=""} {
    hd_puts "<blockquote>\n"
    hd_resolve $comment\n
    hd_puts "</blockquote>\n"
  }
  hd_puts "\n"
