SQLite is a small
C library that implements a self-contained, embeddable,
zero-configuration
SQL database engine.
Features include:
</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID)
    even after system crashes and power failures.
<li>Zero-configuration - no setup or administration needed.</li>
<li>Implements most of SQL92.
    (<a href="omitted.html">Features not supported</a>)</li>
<li>A complete database is stored in a single disk file.</li>
<li>Database files can be freely shared between machines with
    different byte orders.</li>
<li>Supports databases up to 2 terabytes
    (2<sup><small>41</small></sup> bytes) in size.</li>
<li>Sizes of strings and BLOBs limited only by available memory.</li>
<li>Small code footprint: less than 250KiB fully configured or less
    than 150KiB with optional features omitted.</li>
<li><a href="speed.html">Faster</a> than popular client/server database
    engines for most common operations.</li>
<li>Simple, easy to use <a href="capi3.html">API</a>.</li>
<li><a href="tclsqlite.html">TCL bindings</a> included.
    Bindings for many other languages 
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=SqliteWrappers">
    available separately.</a></li>
<li>Well-commented source code with over 95% test coverage.</li>
<li>Self-contained: no external dependencies.</li>
<li>Sources are in the <a href="copyright.html">public domain</a>.
    Use for any purpose.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The SQLite distribution comes with a standalone command-line
access program (<a href="sqlite.html">sqlite</a>) that can
be used to administer an SQLite database and which serves as
an example of how to use the SQLite library.

newsitem {2005-Sep-16} {Version 3.2.6 - Critical Bug Fix} {
  This version fixes a bug that can result in database
  corruption if a VACUUM of a 1 gibibyte or larger database fails
  (perhaps do to running out of disk space or an unexpected power loss)
  and is later rolled back.
  <p>
  Also in this release:
  The ORDER BY and GROUP BY processing was rewritten to use less memory.
  Support for COUNT(DISTINCT) was added.  The LIKE operator can now be
  used by the optimizer on columns with COLLATE NOCASE.
}

newsitem {2005-Aug-27} {Version 3.2.5} {
  This release fixes a few more lingering bugs in the new code.
  We expect that this release will be stable and ready for production use.
}

newsitem {2005-Aug-24} {Version 3.2.4} {
  This release fixes a bug in the new optimizer that can lead to segfaults
  when parsing very complex WHERE clauses.
}

newsitem {2005-Aug-21} {Version 3.2.3} {
  This release adds the <a href="lang_analyze.html">ANALYZE</a> command,
  the <a href="lang_expr.html">CAST</a> operator, and many
  very substantial improvements to the query optimizer.  See the
  <a href="changes.html#version_3_2_3">change log</a> for additional
  information.
