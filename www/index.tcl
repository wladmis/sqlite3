puts {<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database
access without running a separate RDBMS process.
The distribution comes with a standalone command-line
access program (<a href="sqlite.html">sqlite</a>) that can
be used to administer an SQLite database and which serves as
an example of how to use the SQLite library.</p>

<p>SQLite is <b>not</b> a client library used to connect to a
big database server.  SQLite <b>is</b> the server.  The SQLite
library reads and writes directly to and from the database files
on disk.</p>}

puts {<h2>Features</h2>

<p><ul>
<li>Implements most of SQL92.
    (<a href="omitted.html">Features not supported</a>)</li>
<li>A complete database (with multiple tables and indices) is
    stored in a single disk file.</li>
<li>Atomic commit and rollback protect data integrity.</li>

    different byte orders.</li>
<li>Supports databases up to 2 terabytes (2^41 bytes) in size.</li>
<li>Small memory footprint: less than 25K lines of C code.</li>
<li><a href="speed.html">Four times faster</a> than PostgreSQL.
    Twice as fast as SQLite 1.0.</li>
<li>Very simple 
<a href="c_interface.html">C/C++ interface</a> requires the use of only
three functions and one opaque structure.</li>
<li><a href="tclsqlite.html">TCL bindings</a> included.
    Bindings for many other languages available separately.</li>
<li>Simple, well-commented source code.</li>
<li>Automated test suite provides near 100% code coverage.</li>
<li>Self-contained: no external dependencies.</li>
<li>Built and tested under Linux and Windows.</li>
<li>Sources are in the public domain.  Use for any purpose.</li>

puts {<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>A <a href="changes.html">Change Summary</a> is available on this
website.  You can also access a detailed
<a href="http://cvs.hwaci.com:2080/sqlite/timeline">change history</a>,
<a href="http://cvs.hwaci.com:2080/sqlite/rptview?rn=2">view open bugs</a>,
or
<a href="http://cvs.hwaci.com:2080/sqlite/tktnew">report new bugs</a>
at the
<a href="http://cvs.hwaci.com:2080/sqlite/">CVS server</a>.</p>

<p>Complete source code and precompiled binaries for the latest release are
<a href="download.html">available for download</a> on this site.  You
can also obtain the latest changes by anonymous CVS access:
<blockquote><pre>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.hwaci.com:/home/cvs/sqlite login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.hwaci.com:/home/cvs/sqlite checkout sqlite
</pre></blockquote>
When prompted for a password, enter "anonymous".
</p>

<p>Note that the CVS server is located on a cable modem with a dynamic
IP address.  The IP address changes every 3 or 4 months.  After an
IP address change
occurs it usually takes a day or two for the new DNS information to propagate.
So if you have trouble accessing the CVS server, it could be because the
IP address has recently changed.  Try again in a few days.
</p>

<p>
Whenever either of the first two digits in the version number
for SQLite change, it means that the underlying file format
has changed.  Usually these changes are backwards compatible.
See <a href="formatchng.html">formatchng.html</a>
for additional information.

puts {<h2>Major Database File Format Change - Version 2.6.0 - 2002 July 17</h2>

<p>Beginning with version 2.6.0, the SQLite database file format changed
in an incompatible way.  If you open a database file from version 2.5.6
or earlier with version 2.6.0 or later of the library, then the file format
will be converted automatically.  This is an irreversible operation.  Once
the conversion occurs, you will no longer be able to access the database
file from older versions of the library.  If the database is large, the
conversion might take some time. (Allow 1 to 2 seconds per megabyte
of database under Linux.) If the database is read-only,
the conversion cannot occur and the attempt to open the database will
fail.
It is suggested that you make backup copies of older database files
before attempting to open them with version 2.6.0 or later of the library.</p>

or if you want custom modifications to SQLite preformed by the
original author, these services are available for a modest fee.

puts {<h2>Building From Source</h2>}

puts {
<p>To build sqlite under Unix, just unwrap the tarball, create a separate
build directory, run configure from the build directory and then
type "make".  For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
$ tar xzf sqlite.tar.gz      <i> Unpacks into directory named "sqlite" </i>
$ mkdir bld                  <i> Create a separate build directory </i>
$ cd bld
$ ../sqlite/configure
$ make                       <i> Builds "sqlite" and "libsqlite.a" </i>
$ make test                  <i> Optional: run regression tests </i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you prefer, you can also build by making whatever modifications
you desire to the file "Makefile.linux-gcc" and then executing that
makefile.  Tha latter method is used for all official development
and testing of SQLite and for building the precompiled
binaries found on this website.  Windows binaries are generated by
cross-compiling from Linux using <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a></p>
