<h2>About SQLite</h2>
<p>
SQLite is a small C library that implements a 
self-contained, embeddable,
zero-configuration SQL database engine.
Features include:
</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID)
    even after system crashes and power failures.
<li>Zero-configuration - no setup or administration needed.</li>
<li>Implements most of SQL92.
    (<a href="omitted.html">Features not supported</a>)</li>
<li>A complete database is stored in a single disk file.</li>
<li>Database files can be freely shared between machines with
    different byte orders.</li>
<li>Supports databases up to 2 terabytes
    (2<sup><small>41</small></sup> bytes) in size.</li>
<li>Sizes of strings and BLOBs limited only by available memory.</li>
<li>Small code footprint: less than 30K lines of C code,
    less than 250KB code space (gcc on i486)</li>
<li><a href="speed.html">Faster</a> than popular client/server database
    engines for most common operations.</li>
<li>Simple, easy to use <a href="c_interface.html">API</a>.</li>
<li><a href="tclsqlite.html">TCL bindings</a> included.
    Bindings for many other languages 
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=SqliteWrappers">
    available separately.</a></li>
<li>Well-commented source code with over 95% test coverage.</li>
<li>Self-contained: no external dependencies.</li>
<li>Sources are in the <a href="copyright.html">public domain</a>.
    Use for any purpose.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The SQLite distribution comes with a standalone command-line
access program (<a href="sqlite.html">sqlite</a>) that can
be used to administer an SQLite database and which serves as
an example of how to use the SQLite library.
